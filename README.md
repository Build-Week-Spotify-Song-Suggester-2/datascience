## Project Information
A Kaggle database of songs or access to the Spotify API directly. We will be accessing the Spotify API directly to pull certain information on audio tracks, and a dataset of 120k unique songs to train our model.

We were assigned to deploy a personalized song reccomendation app by creating algorithm to recommend songs based on user's input song. We created a new dataset of 120k unique song tracks to train our model with, by combining a dataset of tracks from Kaggle and updating it with additional tracks from the Spotify API directly. 

Our app takes the provided user input, matches it to itâ€™s track ID in the Spotify API, and then applies our model to return a json list of top 10 similar songs based on the audio features back to the user. We created both a k-nearest neighbors model and a neural network. However, we chose the to only deploy the KNN model to our app as it was more lightweight and accurate given the time constraint of one fewer workday.
